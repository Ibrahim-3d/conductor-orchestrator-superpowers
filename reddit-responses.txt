> "A Board that forgets last week's decision is just noise"

Hey, so you were right to call this out — I went and audited the board-meeting agent and the board skill, and while the message bus structure was *documented*, the agent instructions never actually told it to write the files. It described the format but didn't have a "you must do this" step. Classic case of docs existing but implementation not following through.

I fixed this in v3.3.0 by adding a mandatory "Phase 5: Persist Decision" to both the board-meeting agent and the board-of-directors skill. Now after every deliberation, it's required to mkdir the board directory and write `resolution.md` + `session-{timestamp}.json` before returning. The agent also returns a concise JSON summary instead of dumping the full deliberation back.

I also wired up a retrospective agent at track completion that extracts patterns to `conductor/knowledge/patterns.md` and error fixes to `conductor/knowledge/errors.json` — so the learning layer is now actually triggered, not just documented.

Thanks for pushing on this, it was a real gap.

> "Does yours manage the context window without human intervention?"

Coming back to this — I think we had an issue where the context-loader skill had the right idea (priority tiers, large file handling) but no actual enforcement. It was more like guidelines than rules. If a subagent decided to load 30 files or read a 2MB log, nothing stopped it.

Fixed in v3.3.0 with mandatory enforcement rules in the context-loader:
- Files >500KB: only read first 20 + last 20 lines
- Files >1MB: skip entirely
- Hard stop after Tier 1-3 files (Tier 4 config files only if task-specific)
- Maximum 15 files per context load

Also fixed a bigger issue — agents were returning full reports (10-20KB) in their conversation responses back to the orchestrator, which accumulated across loop iterations. Now the orchestrator tells every agent: "write detailed output to files, return only a one-line JSON verdict." That alone should cut the orchestrator's context growth significantly.

> "I need everything auto, not only after the discuss phase"

Quick update on this — I think there was an issue where the executing-plans skill was still designed for the standalone "batch of 3 tasks, then stop for feedback" workflow even when the Conductor orchestrator invoked it. So `/go` would kick off execution, but the skill would pause after 3 tasks and ask "Ready for feedback?" which kind of defeats the point of autonomous mode.

Fixed in v3.3.0 — the executing-plans skill now has a "Conductor Integration (Autonomous Mode)" section. When the orchestrator passes `--plan`, `--track-dir`, and `--metadata` parameters, it runs ALL tasks without stopping. The batch-and-review mode still works for standalone use, but Conductor invocations go full autonomous. Same fix on the writing-plans side — when `--output-dir` is passed, it saves to the track directory and returns control instead of offering the "which execution approach?" choice.

> "Have you run into problems with subagents being unable to spawn their own subagents? And agent teams flooding the context window with pointless notifications?"

Hey, so I should be honest — you were right on both counts, and my original answer was a bit too optimistic.

On sub-subagents: the task-worker agent didn't actually have the Task tool in its toolset. So while the architecture *supported* hierarchical spawning in theory, the worker couldn't actually spawn sub-workers. Fixed — Task tool is now in the task-worker's tools, and there's a "Parallel Decomposition" section explaining when to use it (3+ independent sub-components touching different files).

On context flooding: the file-based message bus handles *inter-worker* communication fine. But the problem I missed was the *orchestrator-to-agent return path*. When each agent finished, it was returning its full report (evaluation results, execution logs, etc.) in the conversation response back to the orchestrator. Over 5-6 loop iterations that's 50-100KB of accumulated context. Fixed by adding a "Concise Agent Returns" rule — every agent now writes detailed output to files and returns only a JSON one-liner: `{"verdict": "PASS", "summary": "...", "files_changed": N}`. The orchestrator reads the files when it needs details.

Thanks for flagging both of these.

Thanks! Just shipped v3.3.0 with a bunch of fixes based on feedback from this thread. If you try it, let me know how it goes!
