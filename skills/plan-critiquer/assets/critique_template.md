## Detailed Critique & Blind Spots

### 1. Strategic Concerns

*Vision, positioning, market opportunity, and business model weaknesses*

#### 1.1 [Concern Category]

**Concern:** [Clear statement of the strategic issue]

**Impact:** [What happens if this isn't addressed? How does this affect success?]

**Likelihood:** [High/Medium/Low] - [Why you assess this probability]

**Evidence:** [What in the documents (or missing from them) supports this concern?]

**Example/Scenario:** [Concrete example or scenario illustrating the concern]

---

#### 1.2 [Concern Category]

[Repeat structure above for each strategic concern]

---

### 2. Assumption Gaps

*Unverified assumptions, weak evidence, optimistic projections, hidden dependencies*

#### Critical Assumptions Analysis

| # | Assumption | Impact if Wrong | Evidence Strength | Test Method | Priority |
|---|------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | [Assumption statement] | High/Med/Low | Strong/Weak/None | [How to validate] | HIGH/MED/LOW |
| 2 | [Assumption statement] | High/Med/Low | Strong/Weak/None | [How to validate] | HIGH/MED/LOW |
| 3 | [Assumption statement] | High/Med/Low | Strong/Weak/None | [How to validate] | HIGH/MED/LOW |

#### 2.1 [Assumption Category - e.g., Market Assumptions]

**Assumption:** [Specific assumption from the plan]

**Challenge:** [Why this assumption might be wrong or overly optimistic]

**Impact if Wrong:** [Consequences if this assumption doesn't hold]

**Evidence Assessment:** [Evaluate the strength of supporting evidence]

**Recommended Test:** [Specific, actionable way to validate this assumption]

---

#### 2.2 [Assumption Category]

[Repeat structure above for each major assumption gap]

---

### 3. Competitive & Market Oversights

*Unaddressed competitors, customer objections, market dynamics, differentiation weaknesses*

#### 3.1 Unaddressed Competitors

**Competitor/Substitute:** [Name or category]

**Why They Matter:** [How they compete or could disrupt]

**Competitive Response Risk:** [What would they do if you succeed?]

**Mitigation Needed:** [How to address this competitive threat]

---

#### 3.2 Customer Objections Not Addressed

**Objection:** [Specific reason a customer might not buy]

**Prevalence:** [How common is this objection likely to be?]

**Current Plan's Response:** [Does the plan address this? If so, how? If not, why is this a gap?]

**Recommended Response:** [How to overcome this objection]

---

#### 3.3 Market Dynamics & Macro Trends

**Trend/Dynamic:** [Regulatory, economic, social, technological, etc.]

**Potential Impact:** [How this could affect the plan]

**Plan's Consideration:** [Is this addressed? Adequately?]

**Recommended Action:** [How to account for this dynamic]

---

#### 3.4 Differentiation Weaknesses

**Claimed Advantage:** [What the plan says is unique/defensible]

**Uniqueness Assessment:** [Is this truly unique or just rare?]

**Defensibility Assessment:** [How hard to copy? Weeks, months, years?]

**Sustainability Assessment:** [Will this last 6 months? 1 year? 3 years?]

**Value Assessment:** [Do customers actually care enough to pay for this?]

**Weakness:** [Why this advantage might not hold]

---

### 4. Execution Risks

*Resource constraints, timeline realism, capability gaps, dependency risks*

#### Pre-Mortem: Failure Scenarios

**Scenario:** [Specific way this project could fail]

**Likelihood:** [High/Medium/Low]

**Impact:** [Catastrophic/Severe/Moderate]

**Preventability:** [Preventable/Mitigatable/Uncontrollable]

**Early Warning Signs:** [What would indicate this is starting to happen?]

**Mitigation Strategy:** [Specific actions to prevent or reduce this risk]

---

#### 4.1 [Execution Risk Category - e.g., Resource Constraints]

**Risk:** [Specific execution challenge]

**Impact:** [How this affects timeline, quality, or success]

**Current Plan:** [How (or if) the plan addresses this]

**Gap:** [What's missing or unrealistic]

**Recommendation:** [What needs to change]

---

#### 4.2 [Execution Risk Category]

[Repeat structure above for each execution risk]
